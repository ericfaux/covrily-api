Working end‑to‑end (happy path):

Admin diagnostics endpoints respond with 200 and validate env/secrets.

Admin UI loads (HTML page under /api/admin/ui) and can:

Save/ping the admin token

Fetch Get Link for a receipt (returns null if none yet)

Inbound mail wiring is set: Postmark webhook → /api/inbound/postmark on Vercel.

Supabase has the core tables, primary keys, and basic indexes; example data exists.

Object storage: receipts bucket; H&M sample PDF uploaded; some sample rows in receipts, deadlines, product_links.

Known issues (top):

PDF parse regression in inbound route (pdf-parse tries to open a test file path like ./test/data/05-versions-space.pdf). Root cause: when attachments aren’t converted to a Buffer, pdf-parse treats the input as a file path string. We already hardened lib/pdf.ts to throw on empty/invalid buffer and to require a Buffer/TypedArray; ensure every call site passes a decoded Buffer from Postmark’s base64. (See “Debug checklist” below.)

Vercel runtime / TypeScript friction: if you see “Unhandled type: ‘AsExpression’ ‘nodejs’ as const” or runtime config errors, keep the modern Vercel shape:

// at top of API routes that need Node runtime
export const config = { runtime: "nodejs" };


(No as const; no legacy "nodejs18.x".)

Admin UI: some buttons appeared idle when the diagnostics endpoints returned 404 (no token header). The UI now calls /api/diag/env and /api/health with the x-admin-token; if those endpoints return 404, the UI remains quiet. When token is saved, both should respond 200 and buttons “wake up”.

What to ship next (agreed order): daily return reminders (cron), indexes, and a tiny CSV export. Code stubs and exact files are outlined below.
